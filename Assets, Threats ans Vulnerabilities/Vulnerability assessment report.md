# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**


# **Scenario**

The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability. A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company.

# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2024 to August 2024\. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

Assess the security posture of the company's remote database server and identify potential vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive business data. By evaluating the current security measures and identifying potential weaknesses, this report aims to provide actionable recommendations to mitigate risks and strengthen the overall security of the database server.

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Hacker* | *Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration* | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| *Employee* | *Disrupt mission-critical operations* | *2* | *3* | *6* |
| *Customer* | *Alter/Delete critical information* | *1* | *3* | *3* |

# **Approach**

Risks that were measured considered the data storage and management procedures of the business. Potential threat sources and events were determined using the likelihood of a security incident given the open access permissions of the information system. The severity of potential incidents were weighed against the impact on day-to-day operational needs.

# **Remediation Strategy**

Mitigate the risk by implementing the following security measures:

1. **Restrict Access:**

   * Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the database server to only authorized IP addresses.  
   * Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to protect access to the database management system.  
   * Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to further secure remote access to the database.  
2. **Database Security:**

   * Regularly patch the database server and MySQL software to address known vulnerabilities.  
   * Implement strong password policies for database users.  
   * Regularly review and update database access privileges.  
   * Monitor database activity for unusual patterns or suspicious behavior.  
3. **Network Security:**

   * Regularly scan the network for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  
   * Keep network devices, such as routers and switches, up-to-date with the latest firmware.

   * Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL.  
   * Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Data Classification:** Classify the data stored on the database server to determine appropriate security controls.  
* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and test an incident response plan to minimize the impact of a security breach.  
* **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
